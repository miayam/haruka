# Tinkering with Ruby

I almost forget how I began taking this less serious hobby (programming) to the next level. I was aspiring content writer who
unintentionally applied for a free coding bootcamp (even got paid) run by KMK Online. I passed the test and got my first
paid internship as a web developer. This is the test to get my first job as a web developer.

After 3 months training, I tried to apply for lots of web developer jobs available. Many of them refused to take a glance
on my resume. Who would hire newbie by the way? Except for this one company. They regretfully hired me and
had to invest on a person with zero skill, zero attitude, zero experience. Triple-edge sword that could harm both parties.

However, I grew there, learnt lots and lots of things. I have thanked HarukaEdu for this great opportunity. HarukaEdu should
have raised the bar, I guess :smile:
